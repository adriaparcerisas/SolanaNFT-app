st.markdown('This last part shows a dive deep table about the NFT projects that are currently in the markets that work with Solana. There it can be seen concrete and interesting metrics such as total sales, total purchasers, volume moved, as well as 24h and 7-days percentage growth of each metric. Furthermore, the collections are catalogued as top tier, strong and common depending on their attributes. For the first group, a purple button is shown in the final of the collection name, for the second group is green and for the common group orange.')
